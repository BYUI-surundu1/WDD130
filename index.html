    <h1>Surundu Francis | WDD 130-example</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Surundu Francis" width="200">
    <p>Hello, I'm Surundu Francis, a passionate traveler and social advocate hailing from the beautiful town of Jinja, Uganda. In my journey through life, I have found joy in exploring new places and embarking on exciting tours. My heart is deeply rooted in faith, and I'm a devoted follower of Jesus Christ.

        Currently, I am pursuing my studies in web and computer programming at Brigham Young University-Idaho. Alongside my academic pursuits, I wear multiple hats as a social worker and hotelier, driven by the aspiration to make a positive impact on society and uplift young people. My philosophy centers around fostering self-reliance, empowering individuals to become contributors to their communities. I firmly believe in viewing others through the lens of potential and capability.
        
        In addition to my dedication to social work and academic endeavors, I have a flair for programming and a love for the cinematic world. As a firm believer in self-reliance activities, I am convinced that these endeavors can not only transform individual lives but also serve as catalysts for community development.
        
        Join me on this journey of purpose, where we strive to create a world where everyone is empowered to realize their potential, and communities flourish through the spirit of self-reliance.</p>

    <img src="images/Uganda.png" alt="Uganda map">
    <p>Uganda, located in East Africa, is a landlocked country with a diverse landscape ranging from savannas to dense forests. With Kampala as its capital and largest city, Uganda gained independence from British colonial rule in 1962. The country has a varied population consisting of different ethnic groups, with English as the official language. Uganda's economy is characterized by agriculture, including the production of coffee and tea, and has shown growth in sectors such as services. The nation boasts rich biodiversity and is a destination for tourists interested in exploring its national parks, including Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, renowned for mountain gorilla trekking. Despite challenges such as political instability in the past, Uganda has made strides in development, though it continues to face issues related to healthcare and education.</p>
