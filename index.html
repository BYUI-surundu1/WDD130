    <p>Uganda, located in East Africa, is a landlocked country with a diverse landscape ranging from savannas to dense forests. With Kampala as its capital and largest city, Uganda gained independence from British colonial rule in 1962. The country has a varied population consisting of different ethnic groups, with English as the official language. Uganda's economy is characterized by agriculture, including the production of coffee and tea, and has shown growth in sectors such as services. The nation boasts rich biodiversity and is a destination for tourists interested in exploring its national parks, including Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, renowned for mountain gorilla trekking. Despite challenges such as political instability in the past, Uganda has made strides in development, though it continues to face issues related to healthcare and education.</p>
